# FordFulkersonMethod
This Includes an Asymptotically optimized implementation of the ford fulkerson method, specifically, using Edmondson-Karp
The input will start with a positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each instance,
there will be two positive integers, indicating the number of nodes n = |V | in the graph and the number
of edges m = |E| in the graph. Following this, there will be |E| additional lines describing the edges.
Each edge line consists of a number indicating the source node, a number indicating the destination
node, and a capacity c(e). The nodes are not listed separately, but are numbered {1 . . . n}
